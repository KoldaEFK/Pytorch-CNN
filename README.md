# Pytorch_MNIST

Hello World project of Deep Learning - training a Neural Net for classifying digits using the famous MNIST dataset

ConvNet.py - structure of Convolutional Neural Net <br />
Training.py - the whole deep learning pipeline in Pytorch + visualization in Tensorboard <br />
window.py - a simple Desktop App, where an image can be drawn on canvas and then classified by the Network <br />
model.pth - trained model saved from Training.py and imported into window.py
